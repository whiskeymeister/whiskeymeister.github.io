                <h4>Hello and welcome to my blog "Amateur Art Attack".</h4>
                <p>This is my first 'real' webpage, without using any overloaded CSS framework.
                However, I will find myself bombarding you with boring landscapes photos made with my 
                phone camera - just like any professional amateur would do it.
                </p>
                <p>Pictures presented here were mostly taken in my howntown in Eastern Bavaria, Germany.
                I would love to do photography professionally, however, I can't afford a proper camera and 
                since I'm broke 24/7, I'll just make crappy photos with my cell phone camera. 
                Not having much time on my hand because of attending university doesn't help either.
                </p>
                <p>That's why I've taken the opportunity to combine my pseudo-hobby with what I gotta do 
                at university - write my very own webpage, so I could present these photographs to the 
                world. Up until now, I've been coding very trivial things in order to practise. Some 
                months ago, I coded a webpage for my grandma, since she wanted a web presence to sell pictures 
                of her father, however, in order to safe time, I used W3C.CSS, which makes things VERY easy.
                But this time, I wanted to challenge myself by not using any CSS framework. Instead, I used 
                Flexbox, so I wouldn't have to bother about responsive design and mind-boggling CSS Jedi tricks, just to 
                implement the mere core layout. Of course I'm well aware that this is only a static website and that 
                something like this shouldn't be a challenge in the first place. However, I have to start SOMEWHERE, 
                so here we are.
                </p>
                <p>Not only will I provide photos, I will also upload some artwork, drawn by my very own hand.
                Because that's what I've been doing almost my whole life long and it's pretty much the only thing 
                where I don't suck completely.
                </p>
                <p>So, whatever the reason is that you're here, thanks for visiting this page.</p>
                (Spoiler alert: My photography skills are just as good as my coding skills - not good.)
